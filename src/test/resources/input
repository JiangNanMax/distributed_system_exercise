I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse
I'll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I'll stand there so brave
And chase them all away
A cup of coffee still steaming
Staring back at me, it's blacker than the night
Ay, I'm awake but still sleeping
I keep telling myself I'll be alright
And I know it can't get worse than today
Sitting here and she's trying to rehearse what to say
See, she's in the bathroom hoping I'm not in earshot
While she's getting used
To the sound of a teardrop, splash it hits the tile
And I know it's been a while since you seen me
Smile and laugh like I used to
I've been in denial since it happened
